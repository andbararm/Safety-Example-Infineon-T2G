# Self-hosted runner for execution test

The CMSIS-Toolbox implements and
[Run and Debug Configuration](https://open-cmsis-pack.github.io/cmsis-toolbox/build-overview/#run-and-debug-configuration)
for command line usage with pyOCD.

This section explains how to setup a Linux machine that runs a GitHub self-hosted runner for programming and execution
of an application. The [build workflow](../.github/workflows/Build_NUCLEO_H563ZI_Release.yaml) is executed on a GitHub
hosted runner that stores the build output as an artifact.

## Prepare a self-hosted runner

These installation instructions are written for a Raspberry Pi (mode 3/4/5) running an Arm64 Ubuntu server edition.

> [!NOTE]
> This has been tested on [Ubuntu Server 24.0.3 LTS](https://ubuntu.com/download/server). For other Linux OS, please
> adapt the steps.

## Prerequisites

Update you local machine with the latest changes.

```sh
# Make sure your system is up-to-date
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

# Install required tools
sudo apt install net-tools zip unzip python3.12-venv
```

## pyOCD

pyOCD is a debug connector used in [Keil Studio](https://mdk-packs.github.io/vscode-cmsis-solution-docs/index.html)
that offers also command-line operation for Continuous Integration (CI).

### Install pyOCD

<!-- > [!NOTE] -->
<!-- > Ubuntu Server 24.0.3 already comes with Python 3.12.x which is used in the following to describe the set up of -->
<!-- > `pyocd` in a virtual environment. Please make sure to install an appropriate Python version on your system as well. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- ```sh -->
<!-- # Create a virtual environment -->
<!-- python3 -m venv ~/pyocd_venv -->
<!--  -->
<!-- # Activate the virtual environment -->
<!-- source ~/pyocd_venv/bin/activate -->
<!--  -->
<!-- # Install pyocd -->
<!-- pip3 install pyocd -->
<!-- ``` -->

Extract the latest `pyocd` release from the GitHub repository and store the download URL in a variable:

```sh
PYOCD=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/pyOCD/pyOCD/releases/latest \
  | jq -r '.assets[] | select(.name | test("linux-arm64.*\\.zip$")) | .browser_download_url')
```

Download the latest `pyocd` release using the variable:

```sh
curl -o pyocd.zip -L $PYOCD
```

Create a new directory to store `pyocd` and extract the Zip file to it:

```sh
mkdir pyocd && unzip pyocd.zip -d pyocd
```

Add the path to the `pyOCD` executable:

```sh
export PATH=$PATH:~/pyocd
```

Check if the installation was successful:

```sh
pyocd --version
```

The Zip file is no longer needed, remove it:

```sh
rm -rf pyocd.zip
```

## vcpkg

vcpkg is a free C/C++ package manager for acquiring and managing libraries and is used in the CMSIS solution workflow
to download additional tools.

### Install vcpkg

Extract the latest `vcpkg` release from the GitHub repository and store the download URL in a variable:

```sh
VCPKG=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/releases/latest | jq -r '.tarball_url')
```

Download the latest `vcpkg` release using the variable:

```sh
curl -o vcpkg.tar.gz -L $VCPKG
```

Create a new directory to store `vcpkg` and extract the tar.gz file to it:

```sh
mkdir .vcpkg && tar xf vcpkg.tar.gz --strip-components=1 -C .vcpkg
```

Execute the bootstrap script:

```sh
.vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
```

Add the path to the `vcpkg` executable:

```sh
export PATH=$PATH:~/.vcpkg
```

Check if the installation was successful:

```sh
vcpkg version
```

The tar.gz file is no longer needed, remove it:

```sh
rm -rf vcpkg.tar.gz
```

### Activation

Download the `vcpkg-configuration.json` file that contains the CMSIS-Toolbox:

```sh
curl -o vcpkg-configuration.json -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Arm-Examples/Safety-Example-STM32/refs/heads/main/vcpkg-run-configuration.json
```

Then, update the registry:

```sh
vcpkg x-update-registry --all
```

> [!NOTE]
> If `node` is not installed on your machine, it will be downloaded automatically.

Finally, activate `vcpkg`:

```sh
vcpkg activate --json=env.json
```

Get the path to the CMSIS-Toolbox from the generated `env.json` file:

```sh
CMSIS_TOOLBOX=$(jq '.paths.PATH[]' env.json | tr -d '\"')
export PATH=$CMSIS_TOOLBOX:$PATH
```

> [!NOTE]
> Setting environment variables using the export command only affects the current shell session. To make this change
> permanent across sessions, add the export command to your shell's profile script (e.g., `~/.bashrc`).

## Make binary paths persistent

Before we add the paths to the `.bashrc` file, check the real path to the CMSIS-Toolbox:

```sh
echo $CMSIS_TOOLBOX
```

Make a note of this path.

Open the `.bashrc` file with the `nano` editor:

```sh
sudo nano ~/.bashrc
```

In the editor, go to the last line and add:

```sh
export PATH=$PATH:~/pyocd
export PATH=$PATH:~/.vcpkg
export PATH=$PATH:~/.vcpkg/downloads/artifacts/[enter your folder number here]/tools.open.cmsis.pack.cmsis.toolbox/2.11.0/bin
```

Press **CTRL-o** to save the file, close the editor with **CTRL-x**. This ensure that every new shell has the correct
path settings available.

## Install the required CMSIS-Packs

Now, you have access to the CMSIS-Toolbox which also contains the `cpackget` tool which is used to download CMSIS-Packs
from the web. For this example, we need the device family and board support packs from Infineon.

```sh
cpackget add -a -F Infineon::T2G-B-H_DFP@1.2.1
cpackget add -a -F Infineon::KIT_T2G-B-H_LITE_BSP@1.2.1
```

> [!NOTE]
> Run this command again if the pack versions change.

## Install the self-hosted runner

### Download and extract the runner

In your GitHub repository, go to Settings → Actions → Runners and select "New self-hosted runner".

Select the appropriate OS and architecture (here: Linux/ARM64).

Follow the instructions that are given on that page until you start the self-hosted runner.

### Run persistently

In the last step, you have started the runner manually. If you want to start it at boot time, install a `systemd`
service:

```sh
sudo ./svc.sh install
```

Start the service manually:

```sh
sudo ./svc.sh start
```

Check the status of the service:

```sh
sudo ./svc.sh status
```
