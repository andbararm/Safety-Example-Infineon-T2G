# Traffic Light Example
is an example demonstrating safety oriented application with various recovery mechanisms.

This project demonstrates a **safety-oriented traffic light application** with multiple fault recovery mechanisms.

The example runs on the **Infineon KIT_T2G-B-H_LITE** evaluation board (device: CYT4BF8CDDQ0AESGS, core: **Cortex-M7 Core 0**).

> **Note:** This board has only three green LEDs. Two of them are repurposed to represent the **red** and **yellow** lights. The third LED is used by another Cortex-M7 core to indicate operation.

## Recovery Mechanisms
The following mechanisms ensure safe operation and fault tolerance:

- **Operation Verification**: Monitors the Normal Operation. If errors are detected, the system switches to **Safe-Mode Operation**.
- **Software Watchdogs**:
  - Monitor Operation Verification timing. If violated, Safe-Mode is activated.
  - Monitor Safe-Mode timing. If violated, threads with lower safety class are suspended. If Safe-Mode still fails, the **hardware watchdog** resets the system.
- **Memory Protection**:
  - Out-of-zone memory access in Normal Operation triggers a memory fault, activating Safe-Mode and terminating the faulty threads.
  - Out-of-zone memory access in Communication triggers Safe-Mode and terminates its threads.
- **Safe-Mode Timeout**: If Safe-Mode is inactive for more than 1s, the hardware watchdog resets the system.
- **Critical Faults**: Any fault compromising Safe-Mode triggers a hardware reset.

All fault handling is implemented in **`fault.c`** module.

The system status can be monitored through the hosted Web page, which also allows injecting faults for testing recovery mechanisms.

## Safety Classes & Zones
The application is organized into safety classes and zones:

- **Safety Class 0**
  - *Zone 0*: Normal Operation thread, Input thread
  - *Zone 1*: Operation Verification thread
- **Safety Class 1**
  - *Zone 2*: Communication threads (Web Server)
  - *Zone 4*: RTOS Timer thread
- **Safety Class 2**
  - *Zone 3*: Safe-Mode Operation thread
- **Safety Class 3**
  - *Zone 5*: RTOS Idle thread


## Project Structure

### Documentation
- `README.md` – Project documentation (this file)

### System
- `app_main.c` – Application main function
- `faults.c` – Fault handling implementation
- `faults.h` – Fault handling function prototypes (API)
- `hw_watchdog.h` – Hardware watchdog function prototypes (API)
- `system_defs.h` – System definitions (safety classes, lights, button)
- `zones.h` – Zone definitions and function prototypes (API)

### Safety Class 0 (Normal)
- `NormalOperation.c` – Implements the traffic light logic. The green light duration depends on the traffic sensor, simulated by the value changed by **USER button**.
- `OperationVerification.c` – Continuously verifies Normal Operation. If input data is invalid or missing, Safe-Mode is activated.

### Safety Class 1 (Communication)
- `Communication.c` – Communication stack (HTTP Server) startup
- `HTTP_Server_CGI.c` – Web callbacks providing system status and fault injection
- `index.cgi` – Main Web landing page
- `refresh.cgx` – Dynamic Web page system status updates
- *Other files* – Other Web page source files

### Safety Class 3 (Safety)
- `SafeModeOperation.c` – Implements Safe-Mode (yellow light blinking)

### Board Layer
Contains board-specific code.

Traffic Light application and board-specific code is located in the `TrafficLight` subfolder:
- `ac6_linker_script.sct.src` – Linker script for AC6
- "io_defs.h" - Header file definig lights and sensor mapping on a board
- `cmsis_nvic_virtual.h` – NVIC overrides via SVC (for access rights elevation)
- `hw_watchdog.c` – Hardware watchdog handling
- `mem_layout.h` – Memory layout
- `svc_user.c` – NVIC functions implementation via SVC
- `zones.c` – Zone management functions
